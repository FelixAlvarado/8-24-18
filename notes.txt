Explain how to solve this problem in linear time: 
Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x

1. Initialize a variable diff as infinite (Diff is used to store the idfference between pair and x). 
We need to find minimum diff 
2. Initialize two index variable l and r in the iven sorted array ( one at l = 0 and r = n-1)
3. Loop while l < r 
a. in abs(arr[l] + arr[r] -sum) < diff then update sum and result. 
b. else if (arr[l] + arr[r] < sum) then l++ 
c. else r--

What does data before action mean? 

Come up with data types first before going about solving a problem. (OOP)

What are the componenets of a class? 

Field (data member)
Method (function member)

What is encapsulation? 

The fields an object/instance should only be read or written by methods of that instance class 

What's the diffference btween public and private methods in a class? 

public: visible anywhere 

private: visible only to methods of own types 

What is same-origin policy? When is it not enforced? 

Prvetns document or script load from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from a different origin

work arounds: 
1. send cors headers that tell browser its ok
2. writes a proxy (php script) that makes request 
3. 3rd party proxy service 
4. JSONP 

what is JSONP?

Padded json. uses script tag hacks to grab data from server and tells the server in advance what funciton it wants to be called when the data comes back. Incorporates data into DOM using a server that supports JSONP.
