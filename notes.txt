Explain how to solve this problem in linear time: 
Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x

1. Initialize a variable diff as infinite (Diff is used to store the idfference between pair and x). 
We need to find minimum diff 
2. Initialize two index variable l and r in the iven sorted array ( one at l = 0 and r = n-1)
3. Loop while l < r 
a. in abs(arr[l] + arr[r] -sum) < diff then update sum and result. 
b. else if (arr[l] + arr[r] < sum) then l++ 
c. else r--
