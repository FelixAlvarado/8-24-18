Explain how to solve this problem in linear time: 
Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair in array whose sum is closest to x

1. Initialize a variable diff as infinite (Diff is used to store the idfference between pair and x). 
We need to find minimum diff 
2. Initialize two index variable l and r in the iven sorted array ( one at l = 0 and r = n-1)
3. Loop while l < r 
a. in abs(arr[l] + arr[r] -sum) < diff then update sum and result. 
b. else if (arr[l] + arr[r] < sum) then l++ 
c. else r--

What does data before action mean? 

Come up with data types first before going about solving a problem. (OOP)

What are the componenets of a class? 

Field (data member)
Method (function member)

What is encapsulation? 

The fields an object/instance should only be read or written by methods of that instance class 

What's the diffference btween public and private methods in a class? 

public: visible anywhere 

private: visible only to methods of own types
